# The Beeping Shopping List
Scan an item, have its name added to your shopping list, beep.

Currently a POC - more to follow.

## POC
- Parses the database file uploaded online by an arbitraraly-chosen supermarket chain (price accessability of big chains is required under [Israeli law](https://www.gov.il/he/departments/legalInfo/cpfta_prices_regulations))
- Looks for a barcode in a given image (here, as POC, a hardcoded picture, showing a bottle of milk)
- Returns the name of the product
- Beeps (not yet implemented)
